### Each trial can be decomposed into four steps:  
After presentation of a fixation cross (1), the prior information is provided (2).  
The size of the baskets represented the chance that the fisher caught a fish from the left or right lake.  
This prior is then removed (3), and the likelihood information is provided (4).  
The likelihood information consisted of the proportions of black and red fishes within both the left and right lakes.  
The participants report their confidence that a red fish originated from one of the two lakes using a semi-circular scale.  
Confidence levels and RTs are recorded.
